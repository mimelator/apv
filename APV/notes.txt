BeatDetector notes:
	The BD attempts to give boolean answers to the question:
		Was there an 'event' now for a specific frequency band
		
	The FFT module can provide the following:
		What is the current magnitude (needs to be scaled) at a specific frequency band

	The PulseDetector answers an even simpler question:
		Is this the current pulse of the song?



DONE: Enhance the Audio#BeatInfo class to have two BeatDetectors: 1 for frequency, 1 for pulse
Paramaterize the APVBeatDetector to get a superior amount of precision as well as change the FFT_WINDOW
Modify the FreqDetector to have expose a useful API for the APVBeatDetector's frequency info
Create a PulseDetector to expose a useful API for the APVBeatDetector's pulses


Then start adapting as many existing plugins to use the Detectors as possible.
Adopt a global parameter which increase/decreases the influence of the Detectors.


TODO: ColorBackDropSystems (current color, black, white)


Transitions:
	Use PIMage to record the last screen and then use pluggable filters to wipe the PImage away
	
Global Params:
	Use global user adjustable params to change the level of influence of AUDIO and NUM_PARTICLES

TODO: 
1) Beat Location Systems
	pay attention to panning as well (scale and move left or right)

2) Programmatically switch between systems, factories, locations, color schemes, gravity, etc....
3) Location Systems could also respond automatically to beats
4) Advanced Color Systems
5) Start using the Frequency Bands of the Song
6) Tint 
	Code: https://processing.org/tutorials/pixels/
	float redTint = parent.oscillate(0, 255, 5);
		parent.tint(parent.color(redTint, 0, 0));
		parent.addDebugMsg("redTint: " + redTint);

Audio Line In Notes

When wanting to analyze to iTunes
I'm currently setting the default Sound Output Device to Soundflower
Then i'm running SoundFlowerBed and "monitoring" the default output device
