Marketing Tasks:
	Slogan campaign where a simple web-form captures their vote and presents them with 2 links: twitch or Wavelength Rocks
	The WL helpers (minions) are the emojis: Default emojis should be mostly honery (stubborn and ill-tempered)

	
	Points Campaign where
		Everybody gets 100 points to spend / hour
		They can spend any amount of points 1 - 9 at any time for the current moment
		They will be limited in how frequently they can vote (currently 100 likes / hour)
		
		Plugins that over time fall below a certain like percentage threshold (with a minimum time frame)
			will be retired.  Plugins that trend at lower percentages might be above the retirement threshold, but
			they will have diminished screen time.  Conversely, plugins that are above average will recieve more screen time.
			
		
		RETIREMENT for Plugins and Setpacks:
			Objects that over time fall below a certain like percentage threshold (with a minimum time frame)
			will be retired.  
			
			Objects that trend at lower percentages might be above the retirement threshold, but
			they will have diminished screen time.  
			
			Objects that are above average will recieve more screen time.
			
		
		New users can create 5 set packs until they are 'charged' to be able to create the set packs.
		In other words, the 6th setPack will cost your account 250 points.
		
		However, users can earn points by spending their 100 likes / hour on their liked moments.
		So for every 100 likes you spend, you earn 100 points.
		So a user can quickly vote (like command) and simultaneously earn points to create more setpacks.
		
		When any moment is liked, the following information is gathered:
			* timestamp
			* version
			* user
			* quantity
			* ocean
			* DJ
			* setPack
			* Song
			* scene components (This is a data structure of course)
				* Out-of-Scope: Specific Message
				
		When a dj gets a like, that Dj's points increases by 1 for every like (based on the quantity of course)		
			
			
		When any user spends their likes the following must happen:
			* Do they have any likes left to spend?
			* When will they have sufficient likes to spend.
			* How many total likes do they currently have
			* How many points do they currently have
		
		The more points you accumulate, the more that you can exchange those points for:
			* Discounts on merch
			* Free merch
			* Custom merch
