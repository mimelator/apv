	[WEB] LIKES:
	WL would listen for chat messages: !likeAll or !likeSong or !likeSetPack or !likeDj
		If heard, it would write a new document to Mongo
		Each document would have current (accurate or not):
			Song, Setpack, Dj, timestamp, twitchId
		
	Queries would need to be:
		Top N collections of Songs
		Top N collections of Setpacks
		Top N collections of Djs
			
			
	Those queries could be executed every 10 minutes.
		Each result would be placed into firebase
		!leaderboard would be able to say this result on twitch-bot
			

	* Have stats available in the chat: !leaderboard
	* Create a scene that shows the stats
	
	* How to prevent spam:
		Usage: /r9kbeta
	* How to prevent excessive voting?  Hmm..
