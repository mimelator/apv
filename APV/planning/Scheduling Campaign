Scheduling Campaign:
	Can i query for the status/availability of the next 48 slots?
		Calculate an array of the next 48 entries.
		Query each in order.
		Find out if they exist and if so, what's their status
		
		Each result object should include the ScheduleDocument
		
	
	Can i populate a drop down box that has only certain items available?
	Can i find the record with the next upcoming slot?
		Can i send the email and update that record?  (eg.  NotificationSent=true)

	Notes:	
	I think the queries would be by the timestamp, and the other fields would be:
		(pretty time for my sanity sake)
		reservation status: Pending|Reserved

	[WEB] SCHEDULING:
		i want to show all the available 30 minute sections in the next 24 hours
		
			Alpha-One must be able to access the next 48 30 minute records.
			For all of the records that available, allow that time slot to be picked from a drop-down list.
				If there are no slots available, then i don't think you can create a set pack
			When a record is created for the set pack, it's time slot is set to pending	
				
		Once a set-pack is approved, instead of playing it right away (via the commands of standard-import-hotcommand)
			an appropriate record is modified in the firebase.  (state changed from 'Pending' to 'Reserved') 		
			If i update an approved status to 'rejected' then i'll need to clear out the associated timeslot
			
		Once a setpack is approved, the DJ should have the option to recieve:
			E-Mail 
			
			and share via
				Facebook
				Instagram
				Snapchat	
				
	/git/wl/app.js
	if (process.env.FIREBASE === 'true') {
		...
		require('./util/auto-setpack-player').followFirebaseSchedule();
	}
	This daemon would wake up every 30 seconds
		find the nearest (<14 minutes either way >14) to see if any of the calculated timestamps have a reserved status
		If so, notifiy the subscriber (according to options) and change the notification status
		
		if (within 1 minute either way)
		If so, update the document to say 'starting:<setpack>'
			Then update the remote command file with PLAY_SET_PACK:<setpack-name>


	[WEB] 2 minutes after the new set pack starts, draw a help message regarding the like commands:	
		Must listen to a set-pack change()
		Then, two minutes later (via setTimeout)
			!likeAll or !likeSong or !likeSetPack or !likeDj
